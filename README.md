# Importing and cleaning data with Python
 
These are the first 3 courses of "Importing & Cleaning Data with Python", SKILL TRACK of Data Camp. The 4th course of the Skill Track are already uploaded on this "[Link](https://github.com/Shaheer-khan-github/Reshaping-Data-with-pandas)". The initial 3 course solutions are already uploaded by other people so I didn't upload the code for these courses in this repo but instead shared the solution of links to their websites with outlines, slides and datasets. I couldn't find the notebooks of 4th course that's why uploaded into a separate repository.
