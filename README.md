# Importing and cleaning data with Python
 
These are the first 3 courses of "Importing & Cleaning Data with Python", SKILL TRACK of Data Camp. The 4th course of the Skill Track is already uploaded on this "[Link](https://github.com/Shaheer-khan-github/Reshaping-Data-with-pandas)". The initial 3-courses solutions are already uploaded by other people so I didn't upload the code for these courses in this repo but instead shared the website links of their solutions with outlines, slides and datasets (which weren't uploaded previously). I couldn't find the notebooks of the 4th course that's why uploaded them into a separate repository.
